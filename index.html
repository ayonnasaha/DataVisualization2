                <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Over the years, Australia has become a bustling hub for migrants from all over the world. As a nation built on immigration, Australia has welcomed millions of people from various cultural backgrounds, contributing to its rich tapestry of languages, traditions, and perspectives. This influx of migrants has not only fostered multiculturalism but also bolstered the workforce.</p>
                <p>The 2000s brought changes in immigration policy that emphasized skilled migration, reflecting the need for specific skills in the labor market. The focus on skilled workers and international students has transformed Australia into a global education hub, attracting talent from around the world.</p>
                <p> The chart on the right shows the trends in how the proportion of Australian born and overseas born residents have changed over the years.</p>
