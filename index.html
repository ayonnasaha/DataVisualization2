                <h2>Migration around the world</h2>
                <p> In recent years, migrant populations across the world reached unprecedented levels, with millions of people living outside their country of birth. This map visualizes the migrant populations of various countries in millions, showing how nations such as the <b>United States, Germany, and Saudi Arabia </b> became key destinations for migrants. Countries like the <b>United Arab Emirates and Australia</b>, known for their economic opportunities, also have a significant portion of their population made up of migrants. The map highlights the global scale of migration in 2020, reflecting diverse migration patterns and the profound impact of migration on these nations.</p>
